# QR-FACTORIZATION-GRAM-SCHMIDT-ORTHONORMALIZATION-PROCESS-

QR FACTORIZATION (GRAM-SCHMIDT ORTHONORMALIZATION PROCESS) is a project under DR. Dinesh Singh. This project was covered under programming practicum course(CS571).

In linear algebra,  QR decomposition, also known as a QR factorization.  This is a decomposition of a matrix A into a product A = QR of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R. QR decomposition is often used to solve the linear least squares problem and is the basis for a particular eigenvalue algorithm also known as QR algorithm.

GRAM SCHMIDT PROCESS:

SUPPOSE YOU ARE GIVEN WITH SOME NUMBER OF VECTORS LIKE A,B,C. NOW PROBABLY IF ALL THE VECTORS ARE ORTHONORMAL TO IT THEN ITS MAKE OUR LIFE EASIER. BUT AS PRACTICALLY IT IS NOT LIKE THAT. IT WILL CONSIDER EACH COLUMNS OF THE MATRIX AS ONE VECTOR. NOW THE FIRST COLUMN CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST VECTOR WHICH IS BY DEFAULT ORTHONORMAL TO ITSELF. BUT FROM THE SECOND COLUMNS WHICH IS THE SECOND VECTOR IT SUBSTRACT THE COMPONENT FROM IT.NOW THINK IF THERE IS LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA WITH YOU.

SO TO COMPUTE AND MAKE IT SIMPLIER MY CODE WILL HELP TO CONVERT THE VECTORS IN ORTHONORMAL TO ONE ANOTHER USING GRAM SCHMIDT PROCESS OF ANY DIMENSION WHERE IT WILL TAKE A MATRIX AS AN INPUT AND GIVE Q AND R AS OUTPUT

PREREQUISIT PACKAGES:
INSTALL NUMPY SCIPY MATPLOTLIB

AND DOWNLOAD DATASET:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_olivetti_faces.html.  

OR

WHEN YOU WILL RUN THE CODE .THE CODE WILL AUTOMATICALLY FETCH THE DATA FROM THE WEBSITE AND START WORKING ON IT AS WELL.

USING THE CODE:

1.IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY FETCH THE DATA 

2. TO GIVE NEW DATASET FROM OTHER RESOURCES JUST NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE FILE AND COPY THE PATH AND PASTE IT CORRESPONDING TO THE VARIABLE “DATA”.
 
3. IT WILL CONVERT THE DATASET INTO MATRIX USING CORELATION METHOD.
 
4. 4.IT WILL TAKE MATRIX AS AN INPUT AND CHANGE ALL THE OTHER VECTOR. AND OBTAIN ORTHONORMAL VECTOR CORRESPONDING TO ITS COLUMNS OF ONE ANOTHER.

5. IT WILL CALCULATE THE Q AND R MATRIX AND PROVIDE AS OUTPUT TO THE USER.

6. IT WILL PROVIDE THE GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE INPUT MATRIX A, ORTHOGONAL MATRIX Q AND UPPER TRIANGULAR MATRIX R.
